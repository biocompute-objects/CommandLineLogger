## Basic running instructions
1. Allow bco_entry.py to be executable if it isn't: `chmod +x bco_entry.py`
2. Execute the program: `./bco_entry.py`
3. Type in sensible commands and see the output: `ls -lah`, `python3 -V`, probably others
4. Type in nonsense commands and error handling *should* be adequate
5. BCO entry runs in an infinte loop, use `Ctrl+C` to escape and shutdown
